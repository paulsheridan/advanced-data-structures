A new data structures repo, brimming with some higher-level data structures.

## Binary Search Tree
Binary search trees (BST) are a particular type of containers: data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).
  Our BST uses one class and has insert(val), balance(), depth(), contains(val), and size() methods. When starting the BST, initialize it   with one value ex. Tree(10); the 10 will be the base value of the tree.
